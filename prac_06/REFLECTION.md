Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have made sure to complete the lectures prior to the online seminar.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to start the pracs earlier in the week. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

keeping on top of the content and being an active participant in the online seminars.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

This question has confusing wording
I need to make better use of constants and proper data structures.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think an hour and a half online seminar would allow us to cover more content, but I understand there are time constraints.
