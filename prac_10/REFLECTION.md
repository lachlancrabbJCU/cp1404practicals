# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was excelled at forgetting to start a timer which hampered my ability to accurately track my actual time.

I say my accuracy was close to 65%

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It did seem to improve as I better understood the scope of tasks and started to copy code I have already written.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

There were moments where I felt accomplished, have done quite a lot in not a lot of time. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I only received 1 review, this was disappointing. The advice seemed very technical, outline that using a context 
manager to open files is better. There was very little comment on my naming and readability of my code. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned to better pick up mistakes in my own code, and it was good to see how other students approached the same problems.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac_09](https://github.com/7777xy/cp1404practicals/pull/6#pullrequestreview-2220403940)

### Explanation

I believe I provided good advice on better naming and testing as well as adding or removing variables/ 
constants that would add clarity to the code. I provided general advice on "Brushing up on the imperative mood", 
I could have given better examples of this.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 05](https://github.com/craigshoemark/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-13454768593)

### Explanation

I outlined errors that may have been introduced by ChatGPT, such as `.strip()` being added to inputs, and made 
suggestion about naming, e.g. the use of plurals for non-lists. I provided encouragement on the `emails.py` 
were the reviewee checked the email string for an `@` symbol, something I had not done.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Pickling is cool, I wish it was used in the pracs, also adding a prac that uses the JSON package in a simular way to 
the assignment would be helpful. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I felt that took on feedback and was able to improve my overall coding throughout the trimester.
